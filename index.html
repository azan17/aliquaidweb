    <h1>25, December 1876</h1>
    <p>Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn<br>in London, England. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court,<br>and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.<br>Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the<br>20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hinduâ€“Muslim<br>unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India<br>Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader<br>in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform<br>plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920,<br>however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of<br>satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.</p>

        <h1>Founder Of Pakistan</h1>
        <p>As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's<br>government and policies,and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated<br>from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally supervising<br>the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948,<br>just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and<br>respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named<br>after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name.<br>According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.</p>

        <h1>Illness & Death</h1>
        <p>By 9 September, Jinnah had also developed pneumonia. Doctors urged him to return to Karachi,<br>where he could receive better care, and with his agreement, he was flown there on the morning<br>of 11 September. Dr. Ilahi Bux, his personal physician, believed that Jinnah's change of mind<br>was caused by foreknowledge of death. The plane landed at Karachi that afternoon, to be met<br>by Jinnah's limousine, and an ambulance into which Jinnah's stretcher was placed.<br>The ambulance broke down on the road into town, and the Governor-General and those<br>with him waited for another to arrive; he could not be placed in the car as he could not sit up.<br>They waited by the roadside in oppressive heat as trucks and buses passed by, unsuitable for<br>transporting the dying man and with their occupants not knowing of Jinnah's presence.<br>After an hour, the replacement ambulance came, and transported Jinnah to Government House,<br>arriving there over two hours after the landing. Jinnah died later that night at 10:20 pm at his<br>home in Karachi on 11 September 1948 at the age of 71, just over a year after Pakistan's creation.</p>
